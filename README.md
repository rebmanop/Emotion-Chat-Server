# Emotion-Chat-Server
**Hackathon project**. Written in **24 hours**. The case of the hackathon was **"Internet of emotions"**, so me and my friends came up with idea to write a chat
that could show the mood of the person you are chatting with, or mood of the whole chat group.<br>
This repository is the server. Server uses REST architecture, yes, the stupidest idea for a chat, but we didn't have much time to learn more suitable approach.<br><br>
